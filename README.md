# TelegramBot
Repository with the code of a telegram bot I made while learning Python for the first time. 
It reads commands like /start or /help.
It uses MongoDB for persistence to make sure everything is stored correctly.
It has the ability to store shopping lists and translate texts. It's also capable of differentiating between users.
It's not finished yet, as I want to add new functionality in the future and turn it into something actually useful, and not just a test.
